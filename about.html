										<p>Dog & Co. has become a sort of common name across the dominion server. Numerous shops carry the corporate logo with honor as the company ventures further out into the realm of possibilitites. Yet, this servers infomous brand didn't always have the success it reaches today. With many obstacles having to be climbed, arguments having to be settled, and economic crises to be averted. Dog & Co. is nothing short of a fairy tale story that all started with one single individual.</p>

										<p> In the month of December 2019, a player name __TheDog__ stepped foot into the Dominion server for the first time. Like most of us, he started out as a modest civilian, keeping to himself and attempting to build up as many savings as he could. Few people knew him at this point, but little did they know his brand would be one of the most recognised on the server. As I said though, he started off small, building a little base by a river without even any walls. Fast forward a month into January of the New year. At this point __TheDog__ had accumulated quite the fortune given the few tools he had available. Keep in mind, the server had yet to grow into the size it is today, and getting resources was much more of a hastle. It was if everything he touched became a masterpiece, beautifully crafted and meticulusly chiseled structures were built. However, times were changing and dominion was expanding.</p>

										<p>__TheDog__ decided to take advantage of these cirumstances and opened his first shop. He was given a small piece of land by the server to build a store of his very own. In fact, the plot he was given is where the current UFOHHHHHHH shop is in the old shopping district. There were little other shops around this area as it was the outskirts of spawn. Before Dog & Co. had even been concieved of, he was given a chunk of shop land in a barren land and told to make it work. Almost as a symbol to reresent his hardships and murky position he had started with on the server, he built a little shop called Let There Be Light! This was more than just a shop. It was a place for warmth and comfort amongst the server. It quickly gained traction throughout the server and saw immediate sales by the community. It was due to this that __TheDog__ began work on his newest project, a pet store that would put any pet and any pet supplies into one store in the spawn of Dominion. </p>

										<p> Slowly, __TheDog__ was turning a plot of land that many people shunned and disgraced, into a place revered by the staff and civilians alike. People fled to his shops everyday and the hustle and bustle of the crowds caused the land to see more action than it had since its creaion. After realizing the potential he built the first ever Dog & Co. location right next to his two current plots. This shop was supposed to be a large, multi floor store with everything from wood to enderpearls. Instantly it saw sucess with its cheap shulkers, selling out instantly every time it was stocked. The purchasing of a nearby plot triggered him to start yet another project, but this time focusing on the prouduction of banners. Because of this many people began to understand the genius behind __TheDog__'s success, he did not corner himself into one market, as every single shop he owns strives for excellent products in a different field. The Dog & Co. shopping center had new and differerent products that make those stores stand out and not become muddled into one bland corporate mold.</p>

										<p> On the contarry, each mold used for a shop is broken immediately after opening it. Every store from his pet shop to his headquarters, to his general store all have their own identities and it all kicked off with a light shop. Fortunately, __TheDog__ has quite the hefty amount of experiences with banner creation, as he had previouldy owned a banner shop and co ran and entire island with AMH_OffTheWall on the once famous Omega Realms Server. Despite this, he knew even he had limitations. With his number of shops increasing and schoolwork getting increasingly difficult he understood that he could not allot all of his time into making banners. Instead he decided to run the banner store with SarahBoodle as his partner. Together, they would go on to create numerous banner designs and had colectively earned a great bit of revenue. It was at this point in his career that he really began to make a name for himself on the server. With 3 successfull chains in the shopping district, it seemed like nothing could stop him. However, it was this attitude and ego that would cause his first major downfall on the server.</p>

									<p> In the same month as his creation of the banner shop __TheDog__ made a decision that he hoped would revolutionize the way people play Dominion. Whether it out of arrogance or pure ignorance, __TheDog__  pulled the trigger and destroyed both Let There Be Light!, and his pet store in order to build his insurance firm. On paper this seemed like a brilliant concept. A way for people to make sure they can keep as all their items after death would be nothing less of a dream for community members, given that the server has keep inventory off. Yet there were 2 major glaring issues that __TheDog__ failed to see. One big problem was that a store named rising Phoenix did a service very similar to his insurance store but in a much more effiecient way. Rather than trying to reimburse players of all lost items, the shop simply sold full enchanted sets of tools and armour for a stack of diamonds. While people may not have been able to get their 5 stacks of quartz back, it still served as a way for them to get the essential equipment back. The second problem with his insurance company though, was the fact that in order to build such a big  building, he had to delete two of his most profitable shops.</p>

										<p> The removal of his light store and pet store combined with the underwhelming success of his insurance firm would leave a mark on __TheDog__'s career as his first big commercial failure. __TheDog__ soon after found himself in a self made economic recession. Sales dwindled, and in response, expansion of his stores had to be stopped. He began to see only a fraction of what he had been making in the past before and fell into a hole that he could not climb out of. In addition to the rising prices of numerous shops around the district, __TheDog__ was left gethering any resources he could to bounce back from this defeat. Fortunately he managed to strike gold and build one of the most successfull corporations of dominion. Ater a brief hiatus, he quickly began expanding the Dog & Co. brand across all of his shops, and saw instant success as he expanded into other markets as well. Slowly but sturely, the success and reputation he used to have began to flood back as more and more members visitied his new stores due to the qide array of items that were sold in them. In fact it even became labeled as the 'Costco of Dominion' by some of the community. Through a simple branding strategy, __TheDog__ was able to revamp all of stores under the new corporation. Custom logos and solgans were printed and hung onto every store he owned to show its identity.</p>

										<p> Fond of this new idea, __TheDog__ began expanding his properties and bought any neighboring plots he could afford. The pathway that connected his general stor banner shop and insurance firm was repaved into a stone way.  In addition, he even bought out the Phoenix Rising store, which once rivaled his own business and turned it into a subsidiary to the Dog & Co. brand. Although now no longer needing his insurance building, he kept it for quite some time as a reminder of his mistakes that he made in the past. Soon following the purchase of Phoenix Rising, he aquired yet another plot of land to build his first stand alone building outside of the corporation since the brands inception. __TheDog__ would build a Zaxby's on that plot, styled after the southern Chicken Restuarant. Before construction had even been completed for the restuarant __TheDog__ had already moved onto building the return of store that he once had.</p>

										<p> Just of the river, __TheDog__ proceeded to reopen Let There Be Light!, the first shop that he had ever ran, only this time, it carried Dog & Co.'s new logo with pride. Since then, he has expanded to several other stores such as The Holy Wool Shrine, The Quartz Temple, and a TNT Store. Currently, what used to be the insurance firm is now moved and been transformed into a headquarters to both act as a central hub for all Dog & Co. shops, but also sell merchandise that carry the logo of the new corporation.</p>

										<p> When I said __TheDog__'s story was nothing short of a fairy tale I truly meant it. When he first joined the server, no one would have thought he would create such a business. Likewise, many thought the insurance failure would have been the end of his carrer. However, he overcame every obstacle that stood in his way. Although he was about to lay dormant and get rid of every shop he owned, he nerd poled out of the hole he dug for himself and came back with something greater than himself. Right now, __TheDog__'s to do list is running short, but never the less, we are all waiting for his next innovation and his next contribution to the shopping disrict.</br>
