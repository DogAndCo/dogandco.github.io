											<h1>Our History</h1>

										</header>
										<p>Dog & Co. has become a sort of common name across the dominion server. Numerous shops carry the corporate logo with honor as the company ventures further out into the realm of possibilitites. Yet, this servers infomous brand didn't always have the success it reaches today. With many obstacles having to be climbed, arguments having to be settled, and economic crises to be averted. Dog & Co. is nothing short of a fairy tale story that all started with one single individual.</p>

										<p> In the month of December 2019, a player name __TheDog__ stepped foot into the Dominion server for the first time. Like most of us, he started out as a modest civilian, keeping to himself and attempting to build up as many savings as he could. Few people knew him at this point, but little did they know his brand would be one of the most recognised on the server. As I said though, he started off small, building a little base by a river without even any walls. Fast forward a month into January of the New year. At this point __TheDog__ had accumulated quite the fortune given the few tools he had available. Keep in mind, the server had yet to grow into the size it is today, and getting resources was much more of a hastle. It was if everything he touched became a masterpiece, beautifully crafted and meticulusly chiseled structures were built. However, times were changing and dominion was expanding.</p>

										<p>__TheDog__ decided to take advantage of these cirumstances and opened his first shop. He was given a small piece of land by the server to build a store of his very own. In fact, the plot he was given is where the current UFOHHHHHHH shop is. There were little other shops around this area as it was the outskirts of spawn. Before Dog & Co. had even been concieved of, he was given a chunk of shop land in a barren land and told to make it work. Almost as a symbol to reresent his hardships and murky position he had started with on the server, he built a little shop called Let There Be Light! This was more than just a shop. It was a place for warmth and comfort amongst the server. It quickly gained traction throughout the server and saw immediate sales by the community. It was due to this that __TheDog__ began work on his newest project, a pet store that would put any pet and any pet supplies into one store in the spawn of Dominion. </p>

										<p> Slowly, __TheDog__ was turning a plot of land that many people shunned and disgraced, into a place revered by the staff and civilians alike. People fled to his shops everyday and the hustle and bustle of the crowds caused the land to see more action than it had since its creaion. After realizing the potential he built the first ever Dog & Co. location right nect to his two current plots. This shop was supposed to be a large, multi floor store with everything from wood to enderpearls. Instantly it saw sucess with its cheap shulkers, selling out instantly every time it was stocked. The purchasing of a nearby plot triggered him to start yet another project with Sarahboodle, but this time focusing on the prouduction of banners. Because of this many people began to understand the genius behind __TheDog__'s success, he did not corner himself into one market, as every single shop he owns strives for excellent products in a different field. Eah dog & co shopping center has new and differerent products that make those stores stand out and not become muddled into one blan corporate mold.</p>
